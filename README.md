# RNeuralNet
R code for neural network

# How to?
Please execute the main.R file. The main.R file first tries to connect to MSSQL database to get the training dataset. I have encouneted lots of tutorials which reads from csv files or text files. But I have implemented MSSQL base connectivity to retrieve dataset from MSSQL database. 
Next approach is to scale the training and test dataset.
